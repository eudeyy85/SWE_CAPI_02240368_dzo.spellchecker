#PROBLEM: # Problem
# docx.file can't be read
# inputfile is from online
# The dictionary has many unwanted characters
# Dzongkha words have different unicode code and gives wrong format
# white space when seperating the words 
# the word 'à¼‹' cant act like white space and dilimiter
# everyword is compared, not the wanted words
#SOLUTION: 

#cleaning_dictionary
